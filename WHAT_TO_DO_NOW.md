# 👉 WHAT TO DO NOW - Simple Steps

## Your App is Running! Here's What to Do:

---

## Step 1: Find Your Frontend Terminal
Look for the terminal window that shows:
- A QR code (bunch of squares)
- Text saying "Press w │ open web"
- "Web is waiting on http://localhost:8082"

---

## Step 2: Press the 'w' Key
In that terminal window:
1. Click inside the terminal to make sure it's active
2. Press the letter **`w`** on your keyboard (just once)
3. Your web browser should open automatically

---

## Step 3: Wait for the App to Load
- The browser will open to http://localhost:8082
- You'll see a loading screen for a few seconds
- Then you'll see the **Login Screen**

---

## Step 4: Login
On the login screen, enter:
- **Email:** user@example.com
- **Password:** user123
- Click the **"Login"** button

---

## Step 5: Explore!
After login, you'll see the main app with tabs at the bottom:
- Click **Locations** to see Munnar, Alleppey, Jaipur
- Click **Events** to see the Kerala Boat Race
- Click **Packages** to see the 3-day Kerala tour
- Click **Accommodations** to find hotels and restaurants
- Click **Community** to see travel posts
- Click **Group Travel** to find travel buddies
- Click **Profile** to see your account

## 🎯 Quick Summary

1. **Find terminal** with QR code
2. **Press `w`** key
3. **Browser opens** to http://localhost:8082
4. **Login** with: user@example.com / user123
5. **Explore** the app!

---

## ❓ Still Confused?

### If pressing 'w' doesn't work:
Just open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and type:
```
http://localhost:8082
```

### If you see errors:
- Make sure BOTH terminals are running (backend and frontend)
- Backend should show: "Server is running on port 3000"
- Frontend should show: "Web is waiting on http://localhost:8082"

---

## 📞 What's Happening Behind the Scenes?

You have 2 servers running:

1. **Backend Server** (port 3000)
   - Handles login, data, database
   - Running in one terminal

2. **Frontend Server** (port 8082)
   - Shows the app in your browser
   - Running in another terminal

When you press 'w', it opens the frontend in your browser, which then talks to the backend to get data.

## ✅ You're Ready!

Just press **`w`** in the frontend terminal and you'll see the login screen! 🚀
